# ## What's our objective?
# http://www.cvxpy.org/
# 
# Let's see how we can use optimization to meet a more advanced objective.  We want to both minimize the portfolio variance and also want to closely track a market cap weighted index.  In other words, we're trying to minimize the distance between the weights of our portfolio and the weights of the index.
# 
# $Minimize \left [ \sigma^2_p + \lambda \sqrt{\sum_{1}^{m}(weight_i - indexWeight_i)^2} \right  ]$ where $m$ is the number of stocks in the portfolio, and $\lambda$ is a scaling factor that you can choose.
# 

# ## Hints
# 
# ### x vector
# To create a vector of M variables $\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix}
# x_1 &...& x_M
# \end{bmatrix}
# $
# we can use `cvx.Variable(m)`
# 
# ### covariance matrix
# If we have $m$ stock series, the covariance matrix is an $m \times m$ matrix containing the covariance between each pair of stocks.  We can use [numpy.cov](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.cov.html) to get the covariance.  We give it a 2D array in which each row is a stock series, and each column is an observation at the same period of time.
# 
# The covariance matrix $\mathbf{P} = 
# \begin{bmatrix}
# \sigma^2_{1,1} & ... & \sigma^2_{1,m} \\ 
# ... & ... & ...\\
# \sigma_{m,1} & ... & \sigma^2_{m,m}  \\
# \end{bmatrix}$

# ### portfolio variance
# We can write the portfolio variance $\sigma^2_p = \mathbf{x^T} \mathbf{P} \mathbf{x}$
# 
# Recall that the $\mathbf{x^T} \mathbf{P} \mathbf{x}$ is called the quadratic form.
# We can use the cvxpy function `quad_form(x,P)` to get the quadratic form.
# 
# ### Distance from index weights
# We want portfolio weights that track the index closely.  So we want to minimize the distance between them.
# Recall from the Pythagorean theorem that you can get the distance between two points in an x,y plane by adding the square of the x and y distances and taking the square root.  Extending this to any number of dimensions is called the L2 norm.  So: $\sqrt{\sum_{1}^{n}(weight_i - indexWeight_i)^2}$  Can also be written as $\left \| \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{index} \right \|_2$.  There's a cvxpy function called [norm()](https://www.cvxpy.org/api_reference/cvxpy.atoms.other_atoms.html#norm)
# `norm(x, p=2, axis=None)`.  The default is already set to find an L2 norm, so you would pass in one argument, which is the difference between your portfolio weights and the index weights.
# 
# ### objective function
# We want to minimize both the portfolio variance and the distance of the portfolio weights from the index weights.
# We also want to choose a `scale` constant, which is $\lambda$ in the expression. This lets us choose how much priority we give to minimizing the difference from the index, relative to minimizing the variance of the portfolio.  If you choose a higher value for `scale` ($\lambda$), do you think this gives more priority to minimizing the difference, or minimizing the variance?
# 
# We can find the objective function using cvxpy `objective = cvx.Minimize()`.  Can you guess what to pass into this function?
# 
# ### constraints
# We can also define our constraints in a list.  For example, you'd want the weights to sum to one. So $\sum_{1}^{n}x = 1$.  You may also need to go long only, which means no shorting, so no negative weights.  So $x_i >0 $ for all $i$. you could save a variable as `[x >= 0, sum(x) == 1]`, where x was created using `cvx.Variable()`.

# ### optimization
# So now that we have our objective function and constraints, we can solve for the values of $\mathbf{x}$.
# cvxpy has the constructor `Problem(objective, constraints)`, which returns a `Problem` object.
# 
# The `Problem` object has a function solve(), which returns the minimum of the solution.  In this case, this is the minimum variance of the portfolio.
# 
# It also updates the vector $\mathbf{x}$.
# 
# We can check out the values of $x_A$ and $x_B$ that gave the minimum portfolio variance by using `x.value`
