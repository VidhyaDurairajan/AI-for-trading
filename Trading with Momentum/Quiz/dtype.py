# ## Data Type Object
# Let's look into how you might generate positions from signals. To do that, we first need to know about `dtype` or data type objects in Numpy.
# 
# A [data type object](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/arrays.dtypes.html) is a class that represents the data. It's similar to a [data type](data type), but contains [more information](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/arrays.dtypes.html) about the data. Let's see an example of a data type object in Numpy using the array `array`.

# In[2]:


import numpy as np

array = np.arange(10)

print(array)
print(type(array))
print(array.dtype)


# From this, we see `array` is a `numpy.ndarray` with the data `[0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]` represented as `int64` (64-bit integer).
# 
# Let's see what happens when we divide the data by 2 to generate not integer data.

# In[3]:


float_arr = array / 2

print(float_arr)
print(type(float_arr))
print(float_arr.dtype)


# The array returned has the values `[ 0.   0.5  1.   1.5  2.   2.5  3.   3.5  4.   4.5]`, which is what you would expect for divinding by 2. However, since this data can't be represeted by integers, the array is now represented as `float64` (64-bit float).
# 
# How would we convert this back to `int64`? We'll use the [`ndarray.astype`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.astype.html) function to cast it from it's current type to the type of `int64` (`np.int64`).

# In[4]:


int_arr = float_arr.astype(np.int64)

print(int_arr)
print(type(int_arr))
print(int_arr.dtype)


# This casts the data to `int64`, but all also changes the data. Since fractions can't be represented as integers, the decimal place is dropped.
# 
# ## Signals to Positions
# Now that you've seen how the a [data type object](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/arrays.dtypes.html) is used in Numpy, let's see how to use it to generate positions from signals. Let's use `prices` array to represent the prices in dollars over time for a single stock.

# In[5]:


prices = np.array([1, 3, -2, 9, 5, 7, 2])

prices


# For the positions, let's say we want to buy one share of stock when the price is above 2 dollars and the buy 3 more shares when it's above 4 dollars. We'll first need to generate the signal for these two positions.

# In[6]:


signal_one = prices > 2
signal_three = prices > 4

print(signal_one)
print(signal_three)


# This gives us the points in time for the signals above 2 dollars and above 4 dollars. To turn this into positions, we need to multiply each array by the respective amount to invest. We first need to turn each signal into an integer using the [`ndarray.astype`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.astype.html) function.

# In[7]:


signal_one = signal_one.astype(np.int)
signal_three = signal_three.astype(np.int)

print(signal_one)
print(signal_three)


# Now we multiply each array by the respective amount to invest. 

# In[8]:


pos_one = 1 * signal_one
pos_three = 3 * signal_three

print(pos_one)
print(pos_three)


# If we add them together, we have the final position of the stock over time.

# In[9]:


long_pos = pos_one + pos_three

print(long_pos)


# ## Quiz
# Using this information, implement `generate_positions` using Pandas's [`df.astype`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.21/generated/pandas.DataFrame.astype.html) function to convert `prices` to final positions using the following signals:
# - Long 30 share of stock when the price is above 50 dollars
# - Short 10 shares of stock when it's below 20 dollars

# In[15]:


import project_tests

    """
